<p><b>Greenville, South Carolina (March 12, 2012)</b> – KEMET Corporation (NYSE: KEM), a leading manufacturer of tantalum, ceramic, aluminum, film, paper and electrolytic capacitors, announced today that it has signed an agreement to acquire a 34% economic interest with a 51% voting interest in NEC TOKIN Corporation (“NT”), a manufacturer of tantalum capacitors, electro-magnetic, electro-mechanical, access devices and piezoelectric ceramics from NEC Corporation of Japan. Revenue of NT for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2011 was ¥64,770 million or approximately $755 million.</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement is certainly the most dramatic change in the history of our company, and possibly even in the Electronic Component Solutions industry. We are presenting a roadmap outlining an initial joint venture between NEC TOKIN and KEMET that will take us on a journey that will lead to a truly global enterprise and one of the most exciting component solutions companies in the world,” said Per Loof, Chief Executive Officer of KEMET. “We are excited about what this venture means to both NEC TOKIN’s and KEMET’s customers and the strength that it brings in areas of manufacturing expertise, product development, and synergies across our product base. The long-term opportunities for people and business growth have opened up immensely for all of our combined employees and the future opportunities for all other stakeholders, customers and investors, have moved to a new and higher plateau,” continued Loof.</p>
<p>KEMET will pay an initial purchase price of $50 million at the closing of this first transaction for a 34% economic interest and a 51% voting interest in NT. KEMET will make a second $50M payment around August 31, 2014 in exchange for an additional economic interest of 15% resulting in an economic ownership of 49% while maintaining 51% of the voting common stock. The value of the third and final payment will depend upon the operating results of NT at the time based on a multiple of six times twelve months trailing EBITDA less the previous payments. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory filings. The transaction is expected to close in early summer.</p>
<p>NT’s headquarters are currently located in Tokyo Japan. It has manufacturing locations in Sendai, Shiroishi and Toyama Japan; Xiamen, China; Dong Nai, Vietnam; Calamba, Philippines; and Chachoengsao, Thailand. NT has a total of ten sales offices located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.</p>

Lowe, Executive Vice President and CFO will host a conference call from Tokyo beginning at 4:30 p.m. EDT Monday, March 12, 2012 to provide additional information regarding this acquisition.
