<p>The low ESR, surge-robust T495 Series is designed for demanding applications that require high surge current and high ripple current capability. This series builds upon the proven capabilities of our industrial grade tantalum chip capacitors to offer several advantages such as low ESR, high ripple current capability, excellent capacitance stability, and improved resistance to high in-rush currents. </p><BR/><a href="pdf/KEM_T2009_T495.pdf">产品文档：KEM_T2009_T495.pdf</a></div>
